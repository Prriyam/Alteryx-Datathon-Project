# Alteryx-Datathon-Project
Participated in the Datathon hosted by The University of Texas at Dallas and powered by industry leaders such as Alteryx, The Walt Disney Company, Goldman Sachs, NOV, and RSM. As a student who had recently earned my Alteryx Micro-Credential and Core Certification, I was eager to demonstrate my data analytics skills in a real-world setting.
