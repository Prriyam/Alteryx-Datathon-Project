Participated in the Datathon hosted by The University of Texas at Dallas and powered by industry leaders such as Alteryx, The Walt Disney Company, Goldman Sachs, NOV, and RSM. As a student who had recently earned my Alteryx Micro-Credential and Core Certification, I was eager to demonstrate my data analytics skills in a real-world setting.

The Datathon was a powerful display of the impact that data analytics can have. My team and I worked tirelessly to solve complex business problems presented by The Walt Disney Company and to develop innovative solutions. I was inspired by the passion and drive of my fellow participants, and I felt proud to be a part of such a talented and dynamic group.

Being part of the Datathon was a truly enriching experience. Despite the intense competition, our team put in a lot of hard work and determination, and it was a proud moment when our efforts were recognized and appreciated. I am grateful for this opportunity and for the support of Alteryx and Alteryx SparkED. This unforgettable experience will always hold a special place in my journey of developing my data skills and I will never forget the impact it had on me.
